    <h1>A Message From Daniel</h1>
    <p>
      When I started this company, I aspired to create the best coffee
      imaginable. This is why every morning I painstakingly board my private jet
      and fly to the Amazon Jungle, and pick every coffee bean by hand. After 48
      hours straight of working, my hands don't feel so good, but I do it for
      the people. The only thing that I consume during these long hours working
      in the jungle is coffee from "Daniel's Coffee". This is how you know that
      coffee from "Daniel's Coffee" is the real deal.
